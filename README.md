# Hi, I'm B. Bharat Chandra

I am a CSE student who is still learning and improving by building practical projects outside regular coursework. I try to understand how real systems are designed by implementing features step by step and improving them over time.

A full-stack web application developed for a printing shop.

It includes:

### Fake News Analyzer

A Chrome extension connected to a FastAPI backend.

It analyzes selected news content and generates a confidence score using a machine learning model along with LLM-based reasoning.

Through this project, I understood more about API communication, deployment, claim detection, and handling real-world text input.
