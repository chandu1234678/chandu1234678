Hi, I'm B. Bharat Chandra

I am a CSE student trying to improve my practical knowledge by building real projects outside the classroom. I am mainly interested in backend development and understanding how real systems are designed.

Projects I Have Worked On
Vijetha Digital

A full-stack web application for a printing shop.
It includes authentication, individual and business accounts, order tracking, payment integration, and admin management.

In this project, I focused on backend structure, role-based access control, and proper API design.

Fake News Analyzer

A Chrome extension connected to a FastAPI backend.
It analyzes selected news content and gives a confidence score using a machine learning model and LLM reasoning.

Through this project, I learned about deployment, API communication, and handling real-world input problems.

Crypto Trading System

A backend-based system that connects with crypto exchange APIs.
It fetches live market data and applies basic strategy logic for automated decision-making.

This helped me understand API integration and modular backend architecture.
